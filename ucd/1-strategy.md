# Kaptain Holiday - UCD Strategy Plane
Stuart Roeszler - Portfolio Project 1

## Choosing the Kaptain : Why the ‘K’ became King.
---
- The translation of ‘captain’ in nordic languages is primarily ‘kaptein’, reflecting the origins of the business concept over an afternoon beer in the arguable capital of Scandinavia, Stockholm, Sweden.

- The mild dissonance that occurs in the sensational spelling of ‘kaptain’ in place of either ‘kaptein’ or ‘captain’.  [Nigel Ross (2006)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/english-today/article/abs/writing-in-the-information-age/7DDD2755BBFBD88DB2E54AF3C72412D6) illustrates the use of unexpected spellings (or sensational spellings) to draw attention to or trademark an otherwise common word are well know in advertising. Samples include Krispy Kreme, Mortal Kombat, Froot Loops, The Beatles, Nicks Kicks, and even Balsamiq. 

- Consideration was given as to how many brand instances have the consonant vocal of a “k” contained in their name: CocaCola, Microsoft, General Electric, Nokia, McDonalds, Hewlett-Packard…. the power of the ‘k’ sound in sensational spelling and branding is evident. According to [Paul Hague](https://www.b2binternational.com/publications/brand-name-research/) on writing about brand names, those beginning with the letter “K” are also fun, easier to remember and simple vocals for a vast array of languages.
  
- This, together with the use of the light and memorable wording of Kaptain Holiday to clearly and simply promote the core value proposition of this unique business concept: *"to help guide your business (ship/plane) while you are away for a shot break (holiday), with ease."*

- Consideration to the risk of trivialising the serious purpose of a commercial firm connecting proxy management services to clients, the memorable nature of the nomenclature has been considered valuable, and domain name ‘kaptainholiday’ was chosen.
