# Kaptain Holiday - UCD Strategy Plane
Stuart Roeszler - Portfolio Project 1

## Choosing the Kaptain : Why the ‘K’ became King.
---
- The translation of ‘captain’ in nordic languages is primarily ‘kaptein’, reflecting the origins of the business concept over an afternoon beer in the arguable capital of Scandinavia, Stockholm, Sweden.

- The mild dissonance that occurs in the sensational spelling of ‘kaptain’ in place of either ‘kaptein’ or ‘captain’.  [Nigel Ross (2006)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/english-today/article/abs/writing-in-the-information-age/7DDD2755BBFBD88DB2E54AF3C72412D6) illustrates the use of unexpected spellings (or sensational spellings) to draw attention to or trademark an otherwise common word are well know in advertising. Samples include Krispy Kreme, Mortal Kombat, Froot Loops, The Beatles, Nicks Kicks, and even Balsamiq. 

- Consideration was given as to how many brand instances have the consonant vocal of a “k” contained in their name: CocaCola, Microsoft, General Electric, Nokia, McDonalds, Hewlett-Packard…. the power of the ‘k’ sound in sensational spelling and branding is evident. According to [Paul Hague](https://www.b2binternational.com/publications/brand-name-research/) on writing about brand names, those beginning with the letter “K” are also fun, easier to remember and simple vocals for a vast array of languages.
  
- This, together with the use of the light and memorable wording of Kaptain Holiday to clearly and simply promote the core value proposition of this unique business concept: *"to help guide your business (ship/plane) while you are away for a shot break (holiday), with ease."*

- Consideration to the risk of trivialising the serious purpose of a commercial firm connecting proxy management services to clients, the memorable nature of the nomenclature has been considered valuable, and domain name ‘kaptainholiday’ was chosen.

## Tradeoff Considerations
### What is worth doing?
- Simple one page site with functionality to convey service offering and theoretical customer interactions
### Value Roadmap (for the users and the business)

__Must Address__
-  Design an interactive Front-End web application using HTML and CSS based on the principles of user experience design, accessibility and responsivity
- Test a Front-End web application through the development, implementation and deployment stages
- Deploy a Front-End web application to a Cloud platform
- Maximise future maintainability through documentation, code structure and organisation
- Demonstrate and document the development process through a version control system such as GitHub

__Should Address__
- Information Hierarchy
  - Semantic markup is used to convey structure - all information displayed on the site is presented in an organised fashion, with each piece of information being easy to find
  - All resources on the site are easy to find, allowing users to navigate the layout of the site intuitively
  - Information is presented and categorised in terms of its priority

- User Control

  - All interaction with the site would be likely to produce a positive emotional response within the user. This is down to the flow of information layout, use of colour, clear and unambiguous navigation structures and all interaction feedback
  - when displaying media files, the site avoids autoplay of audio; instead, let the user initiate and control such actions

- Consistency

  - Evident across all pages/sections and covers interactivity as well as design
Confirmation
  - User actions are confirmed where appropriate, feedback is given at all times

- Accessibility

  - There is clear conformity to accessibility guidelines across all pages/sections and in all interactivity


- Consistent and appropriate naming conventions within code and in file naming, e.g.

  - File names and class names are descriptive and consistent 
  - For cross-platform compatibility, file and directory names will not have spaces in them and will be lower-case only
  - All HTML attributes and CSS rules are consistent in format, follow standards for the language and are appropriate and meaningful

- File structure

  - Whenever relevant, files are grouped in directories by file type (e.g. an assets directory will contain all static files, and code may be organised into sub-directories such as CSS, etc.)
  - There is a clear separation between custom code and any external files (for example, library files are all inside a directory named 'libraries')
  - Files are named consistently and descriptively, without spaces or capitalisation to allow for cross-platform compatibility.

- Readability

  - Code is indented in a consistent manner to ease readability, and there are no unnecessary repeated blank lines (and never more than 2)
  - Id/class/attribute names clearly indicate their purpose
  - CSS code is split into well-defined and commented sections
  - Semantic markup is used to structure HTML code
  - HTML and CSS are kept in separate, linked files
  - CSS files are linked to in the HTML file’s head element

- Comments

  - All custom code files include clear and relevant comments explaining the purpose of code segments

- Compliant code

  - HTML code passes through the official W3C validator with no issues
  - CSS code passes through the official (Jigsaw) validator with no issues
  
- Robust code

  - No logic errors are found when running code
  - Errors caused by user actions are handled
  - Inputs are validated when necessary.
  - The full design is implemented, providing a good solution to the users' demands and expectations.

- Real-world application

  - Clearly understandable site-specific content is used rather than Lorem Ipsum placeholder text
  - All links to external pages open in a separate tab when clicked
  - Any custom video content is fit for purpose

- Version control systems are used effectively:
  - all code is managed in git with commit messages that reflect the specific reason for the commit
  - there is a separate, well-defined commit for each individual feature/fix
  - there are no very large commits which make it harder to understand the development process and could lead the assessor to suspect plagiarism

- The solution’s purpose is documented:
- The purpose of the application is clearly described in the README - key project goals, target audience, screenshots


__Unwise to invest time in__
- Areas of coding expertise that wander too far from the assignment brief. Possibly one or two exaples as a playful interaction and learning experience.
- In depth UCD analysis past strategic stage
- More than 4 cups of coffee per day

### What are we making?
- A static front-end site to present useful information to users, using all the technologies that I have learned about so far in the [Diploma in Software Development](https://codeinstitute.net/se/full-stack-software-development-diploma/) with the [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/), Ireland.
### What Value will it add?
- Demonstrate my current learning within the course
- Highlight opportunities for future site devlopment in my learning 
- Visually display at the front end a business idea to potential stakehlders / investors
### Target users are?
- Small to medium business owners seeking a short-break from the daily operations within their business
- Professional managers looking for flexibility of employment and/or to test the waters of owning and operating a small to medium business 
- University graduates seeking secure paid roles whilst travelling to a variety of cities / communities while gathering small business managment and professional experience
### What experiences compels them?
- Ease of establishment 
- Flexibility
- Opportunity 
- Security
### How is our offer different from competitors / substitutes?
- Intital investigations and interviews do not reveal any service that seems to offer similar services. 
- Business proposition seems unique to market.

### What does the user expect? 
- A user experience and site interactions that are intuitive by nature and easily learnt on a single use.

- Following interactions, users can identify : 
  - What each attribute is
  - That it is what they expected to see
  - That it looks trustworthy
  - That it offers what they have been looking for / want
  - Looks valuable enough for them to stay and/or return at a future date for further detailed investigation
  - Has answers to common quesitons available immediately
  - Clearly identifies what 
    - Actions they can take now
    - How they can learn more
    - How they can contact someone
