## Testing 
---
- I tested that this page works in different browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge.
- I confimred that this project is responsive, looks good and functions on all standard screen sizes using the devtools device toolbar that accompanies the google chrome browser.
- I confirmed that the navigation, header, about us, sign up and contact text are all readable and easy to understand.
- I have confirmed that the form works: requires entries in every relevant field, will only accept email in the email field, and the submit button works.

_In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals._

_In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes._

_You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet._

_If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here._

### Bugs 
#### Solved Bugs
- 

#### Unsolved Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. 

### Validator Testing

## Other General Project Advice
---
Below you will find a couple of extra tips that may be helpful when completing your project. Remember that each of these projects will become part of your final portfolio so it’s important to allow enough time to showcase your best work! 

- One of the most basic elements of keeping a healthy commit history is with the commit message. When getting started with your project, read through [this article](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) by Chris Beams on How to Write  a Git Commit Message 
  - Make sure to keep the messages in the imperative mood 

- When naming the files in your project directory, make sure to consider meaningful naming of files, point to specific names and sections of content.
  - For example, instead of naming an image used ‘image1.png’ consider naming it ‘landing_page_img.png’. This will ensure that there are clear file paths kept. 

- Do some extra research on good and bad coding practices, there are a handful of useful articles to read, consider reviewing the following list when getting started:
  - [Writing Your Best Code](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/writing-your-best-code/)
  - [HTML & CSS Coding Best Practices](https://medium.com/@inceptiondj.info/html-css-coding-best-practice-fadb9870a00f)
  - [Google HTML/CSS Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html#General)

Getting started with your Portfolio Projects can be daunting, planning your project can make it a lot easier to tackle, take small steps to reach the final outcome and enjoy the process!
