### Purpose: 

Kaptain Holiday is a site that represents a 'currently' fictitious business that facilitates holidays for small to medium businesses. The site is targeted at three main users looking to employ/provide services that allow them to take a break from the daily operations of their small business.

- __Business owner / managers__ looking for someone to take over the daily operations of their business for a short time (_The 'Clients'_).

- __Business professionals__ with appropriate training, responsibility and availability to care-take operations within a small to medium business for a contract period of time (_The 'Providers'_).

- __Business Students__ looking to gain small business management experience in an assistant manager role for a short period of time, across a variety of industries and global locations (_The 'Assistants'_).

Based out of Stockholm, Sweden, __Kaptain Holiday__ will be useful for those looking for work flexibility, experiences, travel and/or seeking to build a relationship with a team that are able to comfortably coordinate their business operations while they take a break in the future.

## Other General Project Advice
---
Below you will find a couple of extra tips that may be helpful when completing your project. Remember that each of these projects will become part of your final portfolio so it’s important to allow enough time to showcase your best work! 

- One of the most basic elements of keeping a healthy commit history is with the commit message. When getting started with your project, read through [this article](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) by Chris Beams on How to Write  a Git Commit Message 
  - Make sure to keep the messages in the imperative mood 

- When naming the files in your project directory, make sure to consider meaningful naming of files, point to specific names and sections of content.
  - For example, instead of naming an image used ‘image1.png’ consider naming it ‘landing_page_img.png’. This will ensure that there are clear file paths kept. 

- Do some extra research on good and bad coding practices, there are a handful of useful articles to read, consider reviewing the following list when getting started:
  - [Writing Your Best Code](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/writing-your-best-code/)
  - [HTML & CSS Coding Best Practices](https://medium.com/@inceptiondj.info/html-css-coding-best-practice-fadb9870a00f)
  - [Google HTML/CSS Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html#General)

Getting started with your Portfolio Projects can be daunting, planning your project can make it a lot easier to tackle, take small steps to reach the final outcome and enjoy the process!
